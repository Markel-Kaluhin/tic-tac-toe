Description
-----------

This product is designed to play tic tac toe with another people.

It runs on Python 3.10 and has no backward compatibility with Python 3.7 since I'm using the walrus operators and other cool newest features from latest stable Python version.

Therefore, to use it, you will need to create an appropriate environment, if you didn't have it installed earlier.
Here is a helpful link: [Pipenv manual]

You need to install dependencies after that. Run: ```pipenv install```

Well done, you're ready to start, just run ```python run.py``` in root project folder with your activated environment and have fun.
